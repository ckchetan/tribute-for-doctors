		<p> <strong>The</strong> 2019–2020 coronavirus pandemic is upending life on a global level as we know it. The highly infectious coronavirus disease 2019 (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19">COVID-19</a>) is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). It was first seen in 
			<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wuhan">Wuhan</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubei">Hubei</a>, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/may/27/did-covid-come-from-a-wuhan-lab-what-we-know-so-far">China</a> where its outbreak was first identified in December 2019. After almost 3 months, on March 11, 2020, the<a href="https://www.who.int/"> World Health Organization</a> recognized it as a pandemic considering its significant ongoing spread in multiple countries across the world.</p>
		


			<p>While on one hand people across <a href="https://in.search.yahoo.com/search?fr=mcafee&type=E211IN0G91539&p=india">India</a> and around the globe are largely confined to their homes with businesses and educational institutions all shut down in an attempt to contain the virus, and on the other hand doctors, health-care workers, and medical staff members are leading the battle against<a href="https://covid19.who.int/"> COVID-19</a> from the front. Putting their own lives at risk with selfless determination for the sake of saving lives, they truly are our heroes in these challenging times. While they are putting their own health, families, and most importantly their own lives at risk, the least we can do is appreciate their efforts and cooperate by staying safe indoors. That being said, it is good to see tributes pouring in for all the medical heroes working in scrubs. On occasion of the Doctors' Day (March 30, 2020 USA, july 1 india, and Australia), the stories of the medical heroes are inspiring and heartbreaking at the same time.</p>
		<p>Needless to say, doctors, nurses and people working in health-care sectors are particularly vulnerable to the highly infectious disease. In response to the global pandemic, the under-resourced doctors are facing unprecedented challenges. The list of the sleep-deprived heroes includes doctors, nurses, medical cleaners, pathologists, paramedics, ambulance drivers, and health-care administrators. In the fight against coronavirus, the brave medical army stands strong with thermometers, stethoscopes, and ventilators as their weapons. Not to forget, medical researchers are working day in and night out against all odds, hoping to find the antidote to the disease.
			<br>Since the coronavirus outbreak, health-care professionals have not only experienced the gratification of healing patients and saving their lives but have also lost many battles along the way. On top of that, many doctors have even sacrificed their own lives in the line of duty.</p>
			<img src="pic.jpg">

			<p>Every day, the selfless warriors are giving it their all in health-care settings while cutting themselves off from their families and loved ones. The sacrifice that they are making for the safety and welfare of humanity is priceless and deserves lifelong gratitude on our end. Most importantly, we must reassess the value health-care workers hold in our lives and the kind of treatment they get from us. Among the several lessons this coronavirus pandemic has been teaching us, the biggest one is to find ways to sufficiently invest in the better and more efficient medical fraternity and give medical professionals the respect, compensation and infrastructure that they truly deserve once this crisis is over. Moreover, the world needs to work towards advancement in medical research and technology. Nothing will be a greater tribute to the health-care workers than this.

That being said, we'd now like to highlight the heroic efforts of some courageous and inspiring doctors from across the globe who lost their lives while saving the lives of COVID-19 patients</p>

The next day, the doctor too lost her battle to the virus. She leaves behind her three-year-old son and her husband.
Days before her death, the Delhi-based woman had put out a video message to her family and friends, urging them not to take the deadly virus lightly.

"I am making this video with great difficulty. I really want to tell each and everyone who knows me, please don't take corona so lightly. Very bad, very bad symptoms. I am not able to speak. But I really want to convey my message to all," she says in a two minute 20 second-video recorded on April 17.

"Please wear mask. Whenever you go outside, whenever you interact with people, outside and at home, for your near ones' and dear ones' safety," Dr Dimple Arora Chawla says.</p>

<p>This video was shared on social media by her husband, with thousands of people posting messages of condolences.</p>

<p>"It was in her innate nature to inform people about what precautions they can take. So she had actually made this for our family and friends. But her untimely demise made me post this message to the world so that the world can know that you should not take Covid so lightly," the grieving husband said poignantly.</p>

<p>"It was her message and you should be wearing a mask not just for yourself but for the elderly or pregnant women... That was my wife's message. I just want people to know about it."</p>

<p> his wife's battle with Covid, Mr Chawla said she her oxygen level started dipping on April 21, 10 days after she tested positive. She was immediately taken to hospital where she was given Remdesivir and administered two rounds of plasma therapy, Mr Chawla said, adding that her condition started to dip after that.,</p>

<p>Dr Dimple Arora Chawla, or Dipika, has her family and friends called her, went into labor on April 25. An ultrasound showed that the baby had no heartbeat. "The baby had died in the womb. Initially, I didn't tell her. But the doctors said we will need to get her to do a caesarean and abort the baby so that it does not harm her," her husband said.</p>

<p>"She was very brave and strong." The young woman, however, died the next morning.</p>

<p>Pregnant and lactating women have not been part of any COVID-19 vaccine clinical trial in India so far and thus, the government has advised that these two groups should not be administered the vaccine.</p>

	<h3><U>FINAL WORD</U>:</h3>
	<p>While the deadly virus has brought attention to the inadequacies in the health-care systems across the globe, doctors and health-care workers have been risking their lives to save all of us. They are also risking the lives of their family members, which indeed is a huge sacrifice. On top of that, the shortage of face masks, shields, and protective gear is not helping. And this makes the efforts of the medical workers even more extraordinary. On occasion of the<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Doctors%27_Day">Doctors' Day</a>(july 1st in india), the stories of the medical heroes putting themselves on the forefront to fight the virus are inspiring and heartbreaking at the same time. They deserve all the appreciation and support. The sacrifice of doctors and healthcare workers across the globe will not go to waste. Humanity will always be grateful to them for what they are doing during these unprecedented times. The respect for healthcare professionals has grown manifolds in the hearts of people. It is good to see that the Government of India along with the governments worldwide have decided to allocate more budget for healthcare in their respective countries. The world is taking the health, healthcare professionals and hospitals more seriously, as it appears. More work is expected to be done for hospitals and intensive care units (ICUs) to strengthen the healthcare infrastructure in India as well as in countries across the world.</p>
